 1.
 Li et al. [69] This study
 underscores the importance of accurate stock price forecasting in the financial sector, enabling investors to make informed decisions. The authors acknowledge the limitations
 of traditional statistical methods and position machine learning and deep learning as
 promising alternatives. The methodology includes data preprocessing to address imbal
ances in the distribution of news data and to enrich the dataset with technical indicators.
 The model architecture features a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for feature extraction,
 GANs for generating synthetic data, and a Transformer-based attention mechanism for
 focused data analysis.

### Herausforderungen
1.
 However, the inability
 to extract deep features from stock data to bridge the gap in predictive ability between
 machines and humans is one of the primary limitations of traditional machine learning
 methods.

 Moreover, the stock market is affected by random noise generated by participants with different viewpoints, making its movements complicated and difficult to predict.

 The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) argues that stock prices are driven by all observable information and relevant news (Fama, 1965, Fama et al., 1969).

 4.
the stock market is a time series problem, leading to temporal dependence in financial data, and the effectiveness of a large amount of historical information will thus be reduced over time

 Nguyen et al. [34] investigated the relationship between social media sentiment and stock
 market fluctuations, concluding that sentiment analysis enhances the accuracy of stock
 forecasts. In [35], financial indicators were used to select the best stocks from the Taiwan
 stock market. Malandri et al. [36] demonstrated that public sentiment is correlated with
 f
 inancial markets and has an impact on optimal asset allocation. Rajput et al. [37] classified
 the text information into positive, negative, and neutral categories, and then predicted the
 stock trend based on the sentiment classification. Sohangir et al. [38] used several typical
 neural network methods, such as RNN and CNN,toimprove the performance of sentiment
 analysis in classification models for stock prediction. Inspired by the success of attention
 mechanisms, Shi et al. [20] proposed a hybrid architecture that combines CNN-LSTM

 and XGBoost with an attention mechanism. The hybrid model focuses on critical textual
 information for stock prediction. Ali et al. [39] designed a model for opinion mining to
 extract investorsâ€™ opinions using a part-of-speech graph model.

 We can see that TEANet (W/O text) yields the worst results, showing that stock movements are affected by a variety of factors other than historical price. Even compared to the baseline models described above, TEANet (W/O text) is unsatisfactory, demonstrating the necessity of extracting text features as input. By contrast, TEANet (W/O price) produces exceptionally competitive results, similar to those of TEANet. Consequently, it can be concluded that social media texts contain a large amount of market information, and several studies have shown that this kind of information is useful when predicting stock prices and even for other financial tasks (Bustos & Pomares-Quimbaya, 2020).
