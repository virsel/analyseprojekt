- Since it is difficult to establish a model to comprehend stock fluctuations, the most commonly used information is related to macroeconomic time series, such as GDP, interest rates, currency exchange rates, and consumer price indices (Boyacioglu & Avci, 2010). Other sources of information include general financial news reports; however, their unstructured nature and discontinuous behavior make them difficult to use. Consequently, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been applied to address this complexity.

- Moreover, social media is a more time-sensitive information source than public news; accordingly, the use of texts such as tweets to predict stock movements has recently received considerable attention. In addition, the data expressed on social media are able to directly reflect investorsâ€™ attitudes, which are among the main influencing factors for stock movement prediction. Consequently, many recent studies have used only tweets to predict stock movements while exploring the feature information of these texts at a deeper level (Araci, 2019, Liu et al., 2019, Sohangir and Wang, 2018). Nevertheless, the importance of temporal dependence for movement prediction remains a critical issue, as data closer to the target trading day have a greater impact on the prediction results.

- combined method is superior to analyzing stock prices or tweets alone. The main reason is that social media comments and actual stock market prices are both factors that are closely related to the stock market and directly reflect stock trends. Therefore, once the temporal dependence problem has been solved, extracting features from text and prices simultaneously and then integrating them can fundamentally improve the effectiveness of stock prediction.
